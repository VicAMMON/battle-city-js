<h1>Exercise 1</h1>

<p>In this exercise you goal is to write a program which will lead a tank towards
checkpoint. Program is a sequence of instructons perfoming consequently step by step.
One example of insctuction is a procedure call:</p>

<pre class="code">move(steps);</pre>

<p>With this instruction you can make tank to move given steps forward. In this
example 'move' is a procedure name. Next after a procedure name are argument list
encolsed with round brackets. There are only one argument in the example above,
and this argument are number of step to move forward.</p>

<p>Another procedure call can be this:</p>

<pre class="code">turn(direction);</pre>

<p>This instruction make tank to turn to gived direction. 'direction' arugument
of 'turn' procedure should be a string. Strings in the Pascal language should be
enclosed with single quoted. This is need by a compiler to split strings and
keywords or procedure's names. So to turn tank to the right (eastward), you
should write this:</p>

<pre class="code">turn('right');</pre>

<p>other appropriate values are 'left' - turn to the left (westward), 'up' -
turn upward (northward) and 'down' - turn downward (southward).</p>

<p>In this exercise tank should move 11 steps forward, then turn to the right
and move another 10 step forward.</p>

<p>Here is a final program source code:</p>

<pre class="code">
Program Level1;
begin
  move(11);
  turn('right');
  move(10);
end.
</pre>

<p>After you finish writing program, click "Execute code" button to run a program.</p>
